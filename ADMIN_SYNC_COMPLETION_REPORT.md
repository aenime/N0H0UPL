   - Added MongoDB connection and collection queries
   - Implemented date filtering (last 30 days for donations)
   - Added activity metadata extraction
   - Fixed import path for MongoDB utility

2. **Database Query Optimization**:
   - Recent donations with date filtering
   - Media uploads with file metadata
   - Admin activities based on data patterns
   - Proper error handling for optional collections

3. **API Response Structure**:
   - Maintained existing interface compatibility
   - Enhanced metadata fields with real database information
